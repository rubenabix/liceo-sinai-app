## batch-agenda

A batching tool for the agenda.js tool that will proxy data to a task that has not been run.

Initialize the library:

```javascript
var Agenda = require('agenda');
var Batch = require('batch');

var agenda = new Agenda({ db: { address: 'db-connection:24717' } });
batch = new Batch( agenda );
```

Define jobs using the agenda module:
```javascript
agenda.define('email-some-users', function(err, cb) {
  // Do Something
});
```

Batch a process by calling the batch function.
```javascript
batch.batch('batch-key', { data }, 'in 40 minutes', 'email-some-users');
```

Subsequent calls to the batch function will add data to the original waiting job. Important note. The timing of existing jobs will not be reset. The purpose of the function is to be able to send additional data to jobs in the queue without having to care when they will fire.
```javascript
batch.batch('batch-key', { MORE-data }, 'in 40 minutes', 'job-name');
```

In the callback, the data will be found in the `attrs.data.jobData` attribute.

```javascript
batch.define('job-name', function(job) {
  job.attrs.data.jobData // Will be an array of the data that was 'batched'.
  job.attrs.data.key // The key used to store this batch for this job.
});
```

Once the job is complete, the key will be abandoned and the job removed for the next job to use (on subsequent calls to `batch()`);

Take a look at lib/cli, or run it via `npm run cli` to see an example. Requires a mongo instance for agenda to run.
